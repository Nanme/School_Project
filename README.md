My School Project during my study in Computer Science

MI44-TP1 : A Fiestel Cipher software in C++.

MI44-TP2 : A RSA Cryptosystem in C++.

We use this table to convert character in binary number :
  A   = 0  = 00000
  B   = 1  = 00001
  C   = 2  = 00010
  . 
  .
  .
  Z   = 25 = 11001
Space = 26 = 11010
  .   = 27 = 11011
  ,   = 28 = 11100
  '   = 29 = 11101
  !   = 30 = 11110
  ?   = 31 = 11111
